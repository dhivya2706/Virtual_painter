# Virtual_painter
This project is a Virtual Painter application developed using OpenCV and Python, which allows users to draw on the screen in real-time using hand movements detected through a webcam. The system uses computer vision techniques to track a colored object (like a marker or fingertip) and converts its motion into digital drawings.
